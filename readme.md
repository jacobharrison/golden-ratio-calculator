Goldie
======

Goldie is a simple app that takes a single number and returns values that are golden to the input.

Use
---

Goldie requires Python 3.x to function, if your system does not have it, install it and run:

    python goldie.py [arg]

If you provide an argument when you run the program it will return the golden values. If you do not provide a value, it will prompt you for one.


Installation
------------

To run Goldie from anywhere on your system create a symlink to goldie in your local path.
